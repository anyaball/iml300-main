    <p>Let's see, maybe your friends aren't busy? Oh. They're at the party.</p>
    <p>You should have gone. But there is a lot of people. Exhaustion washes over you, and tears well up in your eyes. Why are you crying again? </p>
    <p>You put your phone down and try to compose yourself. You chose not to go. It's okay, right?</p>
    <p>You're going to go to<a href="page-10.html"> bed</a> now.</p>
