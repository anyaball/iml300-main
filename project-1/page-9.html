    <h1>You got this. Let's be social for once, maybe you'll make a new friend! </a> </h1>
    <p>Okay, there's a lot of people. It's starting to get suffocating, and people keep bumping into you.</p>
  <p>Tears well up in your eyes, your throat tightens again and your body begins to feel really heavy and tired.</p>
  <p>The feeling will pass. Look over there, they look cute, right? </p>
  <p>Nerves fill every bone in your body.</p>
  <p>You somehow manage to find your way to the <a href="page-11.html">door.</a><p> and leave without a trace.</p>
