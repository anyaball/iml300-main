    <h1>This isn't too bad. There's a lot of people here.</a> </h1>

  <p>Maybe if you hang around in the kitchen it won't be too busy.</p>
  <p>Or you can walk around and find a friend?</p>
  <p>The music is really loud. And there are a lot of people. And a lot of alcohol. Maybe you shouldn't have come <a href="page-3.html">here at all.</a></p>
<p>Your head begins to pound. Should you leaeve? What will you miss if you leave? What won't you miss? Maybe its not worth it to stay. </p>
<p>Breathe. Your stomach hurts again, and you're starting to feel naseous. Not yet. But you don't know, do you?</p>
<p> Relax, you'll stay. We can go socialize? Maybe <a href="page-9.html">walk</a> around a little bit. Or you can go to the <a href="page-8.html">kitchen.</a>  </p>
