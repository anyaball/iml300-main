   <h1>Tension loosens from every part of your body as you drive away.</h1>
  
<p>But its only temporary.</p>
<p>Too late now. Why couldn't you just have fun like <a href="page-4.html">everyone else?</a></p>
<p>Your stomach turns to knots. An ache grasps hold of your throat once again. Each turn back home becomes more and more indecisive.</p>
<p>But you're going home. You didn't want to be at the party for a reason, right?</p>
<p>You finally made it home. </p>
