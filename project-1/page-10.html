    <h1>Anxiety in it's simplest forms</a> </h1>
    <p>Has no mercy, on especially the youngest of minds. Is it really ever okay?</p>
    <p>The smallest of things build an ache in your stomach, a pain in your head, and tension in your muscles.</p>
    <p>Indecisiveness grips your throat with a strong hand.</p>
    <p>Tears seek their way out with each passing moment.</p>
    <p>And eventually pushes your body to find home. </p>
    <p>To find your bedroom.</p>
    <p>To find your bed.</p>
    <p>To fall into the comforting and warm pit your blankets form around you.</p>
    <p>And pull tightly around you in a warm embrace.</p>
    <p>Almost suffocating you as the feeling creeps up again.</p>
    <p>Holding you prisoner to your own comfort space.</p>
    <p>Trapped in your own mind as the ache builds in your stomach.</p>
    <p>The pain rushes your head.</p>
    <p>The tension builds in your muscles.</p>
    <p>And you are stuck once again to the mercy of your own mind. </p>
    <p>Will it ever be okay?</p>
