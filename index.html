        Hey there! My name is Anya Ball and I am a freshman in the Media Arts+
        Practice Program at USC.
        I moved here from Chicago, where I had grown up and lived my entire
        life. I moved to LA in hopes of pursuing a career in media and
        continuing my modeling work. I am also learning to become a DJ and may minor in music production.
        I am working towards becoming a creative director and love exploring
        different areas of media!

<h1> Reading Responses</h1>
<h2>Week 1</h2>
<p>Hello World Wide Web Response:
  Initially, upon reading the first article, I had gone into it with the idea that a website is just an online space to present a certain subject. But as I began to read both Odell and Schwust viewpoints it made me think differently. A website can be virtually anything we want it to be, and as time and technology have advanced we have all narrowed our definition of a website to one thing. Schwusts example on how a website can be a plant or shelf for example made me think about how a website is truly has a deeper and sometimes more personal connection. Starting with the example of how a website can be a shelf, if you take a few books and put it on a shelf for display, you can do similarly by putting links on a website to display a certain purpose. In summary, there is truly no one way to go about what a website is, and there is no one correct way to build, surf, or interpret them either.

<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>Lara Baladis article, "Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age, Archiving as an Act of Resistance" covers the topic of revolutions and how digital media and its viral abilities had an effect on specifically the Egyptian revolution. Interestingly, the ability of a single telephone or video can completely change and redefine a cause or advance in a way of a spread of information. Paul Soulellis's conversation on his experience coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community during a time the internet had also been developing covers a similar topic in discussing how technology and social media can affect the way an event occurs. With such accessibility to information, even in todays times, it can change the minds and viewpoints of people in their day to day lives. Using the Soulellis example of his experience coming out, he explained how he came out during a time where information was becoming widely available to masses of people, in particular for his situation, his gayness was defined by the spread of information on HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. He also elaborated on how information was concealed on LGBTQ groups and minority groups once the Trump administration first took place in office. This can pose the question of how dangerous is media to our daily lives and being. Information can and has become weaponized in a sense, and a lack of information can be used to the oppositions advantage. Personally, I think social media can be both extremely dangerous and beneficial at the same time, and these pieces both made me consider my standpoint on this. Information empowers us, and also endangers us when there is too little, or untrue information available. Social media today has become such a toxic and dangerous environment, and information spreads and is acted upon at rapid speeds. (edited)

  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <p>After watching the video about the World Wide Web, I reflected how I personally view technology, and thought all the way back to the basics. I find it intriguing how we began with these large machines and have come so far that we have technology at the palm of our hands thats more advanced than we even can consider. I appreciate the recognition of the women and their work developing the internet deeply as well, as today, those in power with technology seem to be male dominated. I was shocked at the underwater cable systems, and while they may not be in use, I found in interesting how complex and advanced the systems we use everyday truly are, and how much power they hold in our lives.</p>

  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <p>Starting with Black Gooey Universe, I began reading and was ultimately taken aback at the complexity of the basic concept of color, screens, and how the computers we use today came to be. When the article broke down the first basic apple product called Lisa, it contrasts the idea of blackness and whiteness in a screen, explaining how the production of black on a screen and white on a screen is more abstract than we might imagine. Towards the end of the article, it states that blackness has created almost a foreground for white. The entire concept this article explained around gooey-ness and blackness is a difficult concept for me to wrap my mind around in that it is more conceptual and abstract than the basic code and designs we know at face value today. In the second article, Olia Lialina covers ideas surrounding the User experience. An interesting point the author made that stood out to me was the idea of a dislike button, and the idea of deception and undoing. Oftentimes when using the internet, we surf without second thought in our actions. Clicking a button to open a new window may look a certain way to a user, but behind the screen the intentions and direction may not be the same. The internet is made to be accessible, easy, and pretty, but it is a lot more abstract in it's detail. I liked when the author posed the idea that you'll never see a dislike button as well.</p>
  <h4>
    <div>
    Questions
    </div>
    <div>
      Are there other levels of color and depth beyond just black and white that affect the user experience?
    </div>
    <div>
      Why is the internet so hidden in many of the intentions it was created for? Why are we not more informed of the dangers and hidden aspects of the internet?
    </div>
    <div>
      How does the idea of black and white in technology change the way you view technologies progression?
    </div>
    </h4>


  <h2>Week 5</h2>
  <p>On the topic of surveillance, I was very intruiged at how much surveillance and us as human beings leave a trail and are watched. Cameras are everywhere, whether we know it or not, oftentimes watching our every movie. We leave DNA almost everywhere we go, at a restaurant, walking in the street, etc., and it is so easy for people to know we exist and see that we are there. The topic of surveillance is not talked about often enough as it can be a positive or negative thing. In the TED talk, I steal DNA from strangers, I was very interested in how easily accessible I am as a person, as in if someone wanted to find me, or watch me, or get my data they could. In the eyeo talk, one of the topics that stood out to me the most was the follower app. Where one has the choice to be followed or follow someone for a day. I never once considered why someone would feel this way, or find interest in wanting to be tracked heavily, but participants simply just wanted to be seen in the real world. This brings us back to reality as people, as surveillance can often warp our self image and actions, and without technology it wouldn't necessarily be much of an issue. In the article on surveillance and its negative affects racially, it was an article I could understand and relate to slightly more personally. Surveillance and the way we watch certain people is not something we can change necessarily, but deep rooted racism has affected the way we would for example, follow a woman of color vs a white woman. Trends and support of black women has had such a negative connotation, and has turned society online into a war grounds often putting down women of color and never letting up. Overall, surveillance is an interesting topic that affects us all daily and should be discussed more often.</p>
  <h4>
    <div>
    Questions
    </div>
    <div>
      Would society be similar without surveillance? Would we function differently as people if we were not being watched constantly?
    </div>
    <div>
      How have humans shaped and formed the entire concept of surveillance and why? What inclined us to feel the need to be seen or watch others, and turn it into an incredibly complex function?
    </div>
    </h4>



  <h2>Week 6</h2>
  <p>Initially upon reading/viewing each of these pieces, I was confused by the overall concept of poor images, glitch, and memes. I reread the articles a few times and watched the video on memes, specifically cat memes to start, and began to understand the depth that follows one simple cat meme. The work can be reshaped, remixed, and cycled several times across the internet, spreading messages a single user wants to spread. From cat memes to political messages, these pieces get shared, and oftentimes diluted in the internet. Their quality may be rendered differently and fall victim to editing and breakdown across devices. With messages such as political ones as well, they often get lost in a sea where everyone has access to posting. In Xiao Mina's video, she also expresses the idea that memes, youtube, videos etc. also changes the way we perceive and treat people online. The things we post, edit, re-share etc. become part of our culture and identity, and due to social media and trends, our culture and identity shifts more often due to trends and new forms of media everyday.</p>
  <h4>
    <div>
    Questions

    <div>
      When did memes and reposts of media become so popular?
    </div>

      How does shared media and our ability to freely post affect the way we communicate with one another today?
    </div>
    <div>
      What exactly is a poor quality image and why is it classified this way?
    </div>
    </h4>


  <h2>Week 7</h2>
  <p>Allhyari's talk gives examples and talks about online files and documents as artifcats, and how to collectively share and archive data. This concept of collecting data properly to protect and save important information which becomes history I found very intruiging. Considering so much of todays world is surrounded and survives on technology, a lot of the information and art put out today becomes our new forms of history, becomes artifacts to us eventually. I personally grew up in a time where technology was a necesity, and wasn't necesarily new in todays world, which means many of the earlier technological systems, data, and art have all become artifacts in todays ever-so fast moving world. (For example, the original iphone). Now to protect this data properly, and continue to enhance and develop the world of technology to be accesible to all people, people using technology need to be respectful and careful of the ways the internet works, saves/tracks data, and is overall designed. In Olivia Ross's p5js archive, Ross lists how to reflect and refine our work online. I found this guide interesting, as these are not normally things we think about as we go on our daily lives posting and surfing online. The guide lists things to be aware of from the land we currently reside in, our territory online, our audience, to our digital footprint and what may harm other users in the future. Addae also covers a similar topic, as she debates whether or not collecting some data may help or harm us in the present world and even the future.</p>
  <h4>
    <div>
    Questions
    </div>
    <div>
      How does our digital footprint and current ways of using the internet affect our use of technology in the future?
    </div>
    <div>
      How has it destroyed previous data and technology systems?
    </div>
    <div>
      Is there one set way to go about protecting/ collecting data to preserve it as artifacts and for future use?
    </div>
    </h4>


  <h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>When reading the articles, clicking through the archive, and watching the video, the topics led me to think heavily about how we can use technology to fight and resist certain topics. First, when scrolling through the online archive, I found it interesting how each link had a resource to a different topic and provided information on each cause and the solutions. Some of the interesting indexes that stood to me were "Black to the Future" and "Flesh Machine". I'd never encountered something similar to this index, and this also can contribute tp the idea that social media and technology has so much power and depth, but we must learn to use it properly. Especially when it comes to topics regarding certain intersections, race, gender, and equality. Relating back to earlier topics on surveillance, Im still trying to wrap my mind around how much technology influences us in our daily lives, and that we cannot truly go a day without being surveilled or avoid the surplus of information we recieve when looking at technology.</p>
<h4>
  <div>
  Questions
  </div>
  <div>
    Can a surplus of information such as the index become more helpful/ harmul?

    How would you describe feminism online and the environment surrounding the concept?
